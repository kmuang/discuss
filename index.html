        <p class="font-bold mb-2">I received a job offer mid‑course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.</p>
        <p>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best — and most grueling — time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>
